            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Adventure Time originally strated out as an animated short for Nickelodeons "Random! Cartoons". Shortly (no pun intended) after it was leaked the short went insanely viral and it was starting to look like we would get a show.</li>
                <li>Due to Adventure Times viral debute being on Nickelodeon's platform it was only natural that the shows production was picked up by them right? Wrong! Nick passed up on the show, not once, but twice with it eventually being scouted out by Cartoon Network.</li>
                <li>In 2018 late night host Stephen Colbert made a parody of Adventure Time on his show "Late Night With Stephen Colbert". The parody was titled "Policy Time" and its contents mainly focused on the political issues current in the United States at that time.</li>
                <li>Finn and Jake once featured in Futurama in 2013, other than that there's not much to be said about this fact I just thought it was pretty cool and feel the need to mention it.</li>
