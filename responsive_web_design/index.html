            <h1>What is Adventure Time</h1>
            <p>Adventure Time is a anthology story that follows the nonsensical and wacky adventures of twelve year old boy Finn and his brother Jake. That is what I would tell you applies to the early seasons.</p>
            <img src="images/finnandjake.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Because in the show's humble beginnigs or the first few seasons, it can easily be wrote off as another dumb show that exhibits the nautical nonsense of a stylized cartoon character.  Giving off vibes that would make you assume the show is tailored for a younger and more immature audiance. But it becomes much more obvious in the latter seasons that the show starts diving into a more mature themes. This is when you as a viewer will soon realize as the viewer that you witnessed Finn and Jakes growth as characters as they went on their journeys. It starts to become more apparent that their journey is almost reminiscent  of the viewers growth from a child to a young man. When this relization is met it creates a deeper emotional connection to the viewer. </p>
