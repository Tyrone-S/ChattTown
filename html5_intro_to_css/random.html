    <h2>Who and what are the seven homunculi?</h2>
    <p>The homunculi (Greed, Envy, Pride, Lust, Gluttony, Wrath, SLoth) are the leading villains or main antagonists of the show. They are inteligent sentient beings that were created by a philosopher stone with the help of a very powerful alchemist "foreshadowing". Due to the orgins of their creation, they were each gifted with a small portion of the unparralled strength of the philosopher stone. Each possesing powers and personalities that closely correlate with the cardinal sins they are named after (wouldn't wan't to spoil anymore than that). Our protagonists encounter them many times throughout the story leading to an elaborate game of cat and mouse. Even so their goal is not clear until we come close to the closing chapters of the story where it is revealed that they have been working for a greater purpose the whole time.  </p>

    <h3>Who's the big bad?</h3>

    <p>Now it is  time that I reveal that greater purpose and who do they serve it for. As we come to the end of the series it is slowly revealed that their is not 7 homunculi but instead there are eight. The eighth homunculus being the "Father" of the other seven. He was created hundreds of years before their time. Except back then he was but only a blight in a bottle created by an alchemist named Hohenheim. He observed this alchemist day by day gaining higher knowledge about the art of alchemy, eventually his thirst for knowledge drove him mad causing him to yern to become something more. Through alchemy he was able to gain a physical form but this was not enough he now wanted to become a god through use of a philospher stone. That is why he created the homunculi he needed them to gather the materials necessary to create a super philosopher stone that he could merge with to become what he's always longed for. Unfortunately for the world this required life sacrifice, and unfortunately for him our protagonists were able to stop him..... or were they?  </p>
