    <h2>What is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h2>
    <p> Before explaining what FMAB is, just a quick disclaimer for any who have watched the show or plan on getting into it. Fullmetal Alchemist Brootherhood (relased in 2009) is a reboot sequal to Fullmetal Alchemist (released in 2003) both titles narritives and story are very similar but differ in certain ways as the show progresses. Which means you can watch either adaptation of the show and still have full satisfaction, I just happen to favor the reboot a lot more. Now that that's out of the way, let me introduce you to the world of FMA and the spectacular journeys of the characters within. The story of FMA follows two brothers Alphonse and Edward Elric on their quest to find a philosophy stone after their attempt to revive their newly decease mother goes terribly wrong.</p>

    <h3>What is the philosophy stone and why are they after it?</h3>

    <p>As mentioned above the Elric bothers had tried to revive their mother to no avial. But what I didn't tell you, is how. Edward and Alphonse used the accumilation of all their knowledge of alchemy (The art of altering the physical and molecular composition of matter through a process called transmutation) to create a life equation that could resurrect those loss to death and bring them back to life. Sounds simple enough, except for the fact that all alchemy tied to resurrection and life creation is strictly forbidden and labeled as a dark art do to the monumental reprocussions upon failure. Alphonse and Elric's failure cost Alphonse his body and Elric his right arm and leg. Fortunately with Edwards quick thinking he was able to bind his brothers soul to a suit of armor near by hence the name "Fullmetal Alchemist". After their failure they knew what they had to do, they had to find the legendary philosopher stone(a mythical alchemic stone that doesn't bend to the laws of nature, physics, or chemistry) allowing those who wield it, the ability to carry out alchemy that should be otherwise impossible. This meant that despite their predicament, the Elric brothers had a chance at not only getting their bodies back but most importantly, ressurecting their mother. </p>
