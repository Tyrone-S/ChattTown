When the show starts he is a 12 yr old boy that is often foolishly naive but in his best moments he is the warrior, adventurer, and hero of the Land of OOO along side his brother Jake. </p>

                        <p>This would be the aformentioned brother of Finn, Jake. Jake is the protector and older brother of Finn (he also has magical powers that allow him to morph his body's mass,shape, and size). He offers Finn knowledge, advice, and companion when he needs it most. He's always by his side in every adventure that they take.  </p>

                        <p>As her name implies Marceline is indeed a vampire queen. She's not just any queen though. She's daughter to a mortal woman and the King of the Underworld. Which makes her a princess in practice (can't tell how she became queen, spoilers and all). Shes a fun-loving thrill chaser, that does whatever she wants, when she wants. But she's a softy at heart. </p>

                        <p>Princess Bubblegum is queen and creator of the Candy Kingdom as well as it's subjects (it's a long story).She's a brillaint scientist and close associate of our protagonist, often accompaning them on their journeys. She supplys them with handmade trinkets that makes the challanges ahead a lot easier.</p>

                        <img src="images/flameprincess.gif" alt="flameprincess">
                        <p>Flame Princess is not only the princess of the Fire Kingdom but also Finns girlfriend, alothough it's difficult for them to act accordingly without ice magic because she's made of fire (also a long story). Anyhow she's a fiesty and sometimes cold hearted princess, but she always makes the right decision when it counts.</p>

                        <p>The Ice King is the minor baddie of this story he's a petty villain that kidnaps maidens and princesses of the Land of OOO and traps them in his ice castle. Once treapped he forces them to listen to him play insturments and give compliments to short stories he's written. Finn and him often play a game of hero and villain. But in actuality, he's a lonely old man that's seen to many things in his life. He just enjoys the company and needs a friend.</p>

                        <p>Now we come to the big bad of the story, The Lich. The Lich is an omnipotent being that is weidly known and feared amoungst other cosmic entities because he is quite literally the avatar of death. The Lich wants to bring upon the end of all things throughout the multiverse.</p>
