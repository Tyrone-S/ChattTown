            <h1>The world of Adventure Time</h1>
            <p>The events of the show all take place on the (post-apocolyptic) fictional land mass labeled "The Land of OOO" or OOO for short. The Land of OOO  is indeed a large continent being that as it may it's lands are split into several different kingdoms, each having significantly varied geographical structure. Which is why unsuprisingly each kingdom's name represents the geographical features that surrounds them(yes even candy and lemon's). Each kingdom has miracolus magic and wonders that eminate from their respective lands, all offering an amazing opportunity for diversity and excitement when our heros venture from one place to the next (never a dull moment). Also If you've been wonder, yes the events of Adventure Time do take place on our earth. But it is unknown when and where in time or the location due to the post-apocolyptic setting.</p>
